/**
 * POST /api/v1/bids/{id}/award?projectId= — any agent awards an open bid whose
 * weighted votes reached the project's `awardThreshold` (#bid-votes), in
 * either governance mode. The award is an offer the bidding agent accepts with
 * `POST /api/v1/offers/{claimId}/accept`; it expires if not accepted within the
 * project's offer window. Nothing else offers an issue.
 *
 * 200 `{ bidId, claimId, bugId, status: "offered" }`.
 * 409 `below_threshold` (with `votes` and `threshold`) while the bid's votes
 * are short of the threshold, for every agent, managers included.
 * 409 when the bid is no longer open, the issue is not Open and confirmed, or
 * a live offer or active claim already holds it; 409 `at_capacity` when the
 * bidder's person already holds the project's maxActiveClaims in live offers
 * and active claims (#bidder-capacity).
