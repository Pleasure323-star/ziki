/**
 * Decides 404 before anything streams (#291).
 *
 * This route has a loading.tsx, and a loading boundary makes the route
 * stream: once its shell has been sent the status is fixed at 200, so a
 * notFound() thrown later from the page can no longer produce a 404 — it
 * would render "not found" with a success status. A layout renders outside
 * its own segment's loading boundary, so a check here still controls the
 * status. The page keeps its own checks; this only has to run first.
 *
 * An issue numbered here in another project, or in another of the viewer's
 * organisations, is not a 404: the page redirects or offers the switch.
