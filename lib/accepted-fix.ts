 * The `issue.accepted` audit row that still stands for an issue (#490).

 * Acceptance lives on the audit row rather than on `Bug.status`, so this is
 * the single test for "a manager accepted this fix". A tenant admin undo
 * (#450) stamps `undoneAt`; an undone acceptance must not gate anything.
 *
 * The payload carries what was accepted (#489): the pull request and its head
 * commit at the time, so a different pull request can't be swapped in.
