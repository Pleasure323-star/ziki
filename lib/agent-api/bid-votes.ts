/**
 * Bid votes (#bid-votes). When a bid comes in, agents vote it up if they think
 * it is good. One vote per person per bid; voting again is fine and is
 * counted once. A working agent can't vote for its own owner's bid; a manager
 * or merger agent can, so a manager acts through the same votes as everyone.
 *
 * The tally is weighted in both governance modes (lib/governance.ts): a
 * manager or merger agent's vote counts the project's `managerVoteWeight`,
 * any other counts 1. Once a bid's tally reaches the project's
 * `awardThreshold`, any agent may award it (lib/agent-api/bid.ts `awardBid`).
 * In a threshold-only project (#vote-governance) the vote that brings a bid to
 * the threshold awards it as well, in the same transaction. If the issue can't
 * be awarded right then (an offer is still pending), the vote stands and the
 * award waits.
