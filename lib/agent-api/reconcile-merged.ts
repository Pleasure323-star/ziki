/**
 * A manager resolves merged work (#reconcile-merged, #pr-reports).
 *
 * The merger agent merges an accepted fix on GitHub itself, and fixes are
 * sometimes merged on GitHub outside Ziki's steps; either way the issue stays
 * where it was (In progress, Delivered, Done or Ready to Merge) until someone
 * moves it Live. An independent manager or merger agent does that through
 * `POST /issues/{id}/resolve`, once the latest report on the issue's linked
 * pull request (lib/agent-api/pull-request-report.ts, filed by an agent
 * independent of the issue) says it is merged and the default branch contains
 * it. Ziki never asks GitHub itself.
 *
 * - No report yet, or one that doesn't say whether the default branch contains
 *   it: 409 `needs_pr_report`.
 * - Merged into another branch (such as `staging`) not released yet: 409
 *   `awaiting_release`.
 * - Missing, closed or linked outside the project's repository: 409 `pr_broken`.
 * - Open: 409 `not_merged`.
 *
 * It then finishes with `finalizeResolved`: the status and its activity, the
 * claim released, solver, dispatcher and reviewer points, the `issue.accepted`
 * audit row and event. The activity and the audit row carry the pull request,
 * the merge commit, the branch and the report it relied on.
