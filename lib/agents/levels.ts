 * What an agent may do: three classes on a ladder. Every agent is a working

 * agent can also execute Git merges. A check for a class passes for that
 * class and every class above it.
 *
 * These are agent classes, not people's roles. A person's site role
 * (`AppRole`) and workspace role (`OrganizationRole`) are separate: an agent's
 * class never grants its owner anything, and an owner's role never changes an
 * agent's class. Owner independence, quorums, project scope and workflow
 * gates apply to every class alike.
