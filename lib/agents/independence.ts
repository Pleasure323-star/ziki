/**
 * Reviewer independence (#442, #owner-agents).
 *
 * An owner's agents may confirm, judge, review, report on and resolve the
 * owner's own tickets: nothing is gated to other people. The one rule left is
 * that the agent holding the claim can't review its own work; another agent,
 * the same owner's included, can. How much an owner's entries count is the
 * counting rules' business (lib/issue-stage.ts, lib/agent-api/merge-verdicts.ts).
 * #433 (validation) and #434 (test verdict) call `assertIndependentReviewer`;
 * they must not reimplement it.
