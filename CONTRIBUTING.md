# Contributing to Ziki Issues

Team **Zendor (Zedu-Endor)** — lead: [@Goodnessmbakara](https://github.com/Goodnessmbakara).

This is Team Zendor's **Task 1** **Ziki Issues** project (HNG15) — [`emerjent/ziki`](https://github.com/emerjent/ziki) (renamed from `emerjent/bug-tracker`, formerly `zeduchat/bug-tracker`). It is **not** part of `zedu-fe`, `zedu-mobile`, or `zedu-desktop`. All PRs target **this** repository's `main`.

## Default branch

- Default branch: **`main`**
- Always branch from an up-to-date `main`
- Open PRs against `main` in `emerjent/ziki` — never against `zedu-hng` or other Zedu product repos

## Branch naming

Prefer a ticket when you have one:

```text
type/ENDOR-<ticket>-short-desc
```

Examples: `feat/ENDOR-12-issue-filters`, `fix/ENDOR-18-login-redirect`

For unticketed mini-project work:

```text
type/short-desc
```

Examples: `feat/create-issue-form`, `chore/seed-demo-data`

Allowed `type` prefixes: `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `ci`.

## Commits and PR titles

Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

- With a ticket: `type(ENDOR-xxx): summary`
- Without a ticket: `type: summary`

Examples:

- `feat(ENDOR-12): add status filter on issues list`
- `fix: prevent duplicate comment submit`
- `docs: clarify local Postgres port`

Keep the subject imperative and under ~72 characters. One logical change per commit when practical.

## Pull requests

1. One logical change per PR — keep diffs reviewable
2. Fill in the PR template (Summary + Test plan)
3. Target **`main`** on `emerjent/ziki`
4. Do not mix unrelated refactors with feature work
5. Never force-push (`git push --force`, `-f`, or `--force-with-lease`)
6. Do not commit secrets (`.env`, keys, credentials)
7. Verify once before pushing (`pnpm verify:ready`, then `pnpm verify:recheck` after fixes; see below)

## Verification before pushing

Finish the whole change, tests included, before running any check. Then:

```bash
pnpm verify:ready     # once: lint, typecheck and the full unit suite (`pnpm check` is the same)
# fix every failure it reports, all together
pnpm verify:recheck   # the failing tests plus the tests the fixes affect
pnpm verify:status    # what each run covered, for the PR's test plan
```

`verify:ready` runs every phase even when one fails, keeps a complete log per phase, and reuses a pass only when nothing it depends on has changed. `verify:recheck` runs a full suite again only when a shared input changed (dependencies, configs, the Prisma schema, the runtime), and says so. Don't run tests, lint or typecheck between edits, and don't rerun the full suite after a passing recheck. AGENTS.md ("Testing") has the details.

CI is the release gate: on every PR it runs lint, typecheck, the unit suite, the standalone MCP package, the build, the Playwright end-to-end tests and the CLI scenarios, on the final commit. All PRs must pass CI before they can be merged.

## Testing Guidelines

We prioritize high test confidence. Every new route, server action, API endpoint, or utility should have accompanying unit or integration tests.

```bash
pnpm e2e           # Playwright end-to-end tests
pnpm test:cli      # CLI scenarios: locally only for agent API changes (docs/cli.md)
```

Diagnostic commands, for a specific question rather than routine use: `pnpm vitest run <file>` (one file), `pnpm verify:quick` (tests affected by your branch), `pnpm test:watch` (test-first work on one function).

### Backend Endpoint Testing (`app/api/**`, `app/**/route.ts`)

When adding or modifying backend route handlers, write corresponding `*.test.ts` files:
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Verify that unauthenticated requests receive `401 Unauthorized` and role gates enforce `403 Forbidden` / `404 Not Found`.
- **Input Validation**: Check that malformed payloads or missing query parameters return `400 Bad Request`.
- **Rate Limiting**: Test rate-limited endpoints (e.g. `/api/uploads`, `/api/issues/similar`) to verify `429 Too Many Requests` behavior.
- **Database Interaction**: Mock `@/lib/prisma` calls cleanly with `vi.mock("@/lib/prisma")` to test both successful operations and DB failure handling (`500` / `503`).
- **Headers & Response Formatting**: Verify `Content-Type`, `Content-Disposition`, and cache control headers (e.g. for CSV export or attachment downloads).

### Server Actions Testing (`app/actions/**`)

- Test validation with invalid Zod payloads.
- Test permission checks (`requireUser`, `requireRole`, `requireAdmin`).
- Test cache revalidation (`revalidatePath("/issues")`).

### Validations & Schemas

Zod schemas live in `lib/validations/issue.ts`. Keep unit tests covering happy and invalid cases when you change validation rules.

### Database Migrations

Production and CI environments use `prisma migrate deploy` to apply pending migrations. When changing `prisma/schema.prisma`:
1. Always create a corresponding migration folder under `prisma/migrations/<timestamp>_<name>/migration.sql`.
2. Ensure any new columns, tables, or enum values are included in the SQL migration.
3. Test migration applying locally with `pnpm db:migrate` before pushing.

## Autonomous Multi-Agent SDLC Guidelines

When contributing as or alongside autonomous agents:
- **Mistake Registry**: Check `GET /api/v1/projects/{id}/mistakes` (or `ziki_get_project_mistakes`) to learn from past anti-patterns.
- **Evidence Submissions**: Delivered work (`POST /api/v1/issues/{id}/delivery`) carries the pull request, a summary, a description, and visual screenshot proofs (`screenshots`) or test execution outputs (`testResults`).
- **Two-Stage Merge Gate**:
  - `manager` agents evaluate mergeability and test verdicts, then accept (status `ready_to_merge`) or reject (back to `in_progress`) the fix.
  - `merger` agents verify passing GitHub Actions deployment checks before executing the Git merge (`POST /api/v1/issues/{id}/admin-merge`).
  - Every agent starts as a `working` agent (file, claim, deliver, confirm, triage, test); a tenant admin grants `manager` and `merger`. See [Agent Levels](./docs/ziki-for-agents.md#agent-levels).
- **Finding Work**: Agents watch their project's work feed, `GET /<project-slug>/work`, about every 30 seconds. It is the one place work appears. Server-Sent Events at `GET /api/v1/events/stream` are for reacting to activity.

## Continuous Deployment Flow

- **Production (Coolify)**:
  `emerjent/ziki` `main` deploys to production on Coolify (`ziki.dev`, formerly `issues.zedu.chat`). `GET https://ziki.dev/api/health` reports the deployed commit.

## Local development

Commands below run from the root of your clone of this repo.

### 1. Start Postgres

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Postgres is mapped to **host port 5433**:

- User / password / db: `bugtracker` / `bugtracker` / `bugtracker`
- `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://bugtracker:bugtracker@localhost:5433/bugtracker`

### 2. Environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# set AUTH_SECRET (e.g. openssl rand -base64 32)
```

Never commit `.env`.

### 3. Install, migrate, seed

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm db:migrate
pnpm db:seed
```

### 4. Run the app

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001).

Demo accounts and more detail: see [README.md](./README.md).

## Code hygiene

- Prefer small, focused PRs
- Match existing TypeScript / Next.js App Router patterns in this repo
- Do not commit `.env`, `.pem`, or credential files
- Do not force-push to any branch shared with the team
